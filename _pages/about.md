I'm Heidi, I work in the space industry. When I'm not working, I can usually be found hiking across East Devon and Dartmoor. This website is an excuse to note things down so I don't forget what I've done with my career.

P.S. Thiemann is pronounced 'tee-man'.

In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM)
======

Since 2025, I have worked as a project manager at [Orbit Fab UK](https://www.orbitfab.com/), a company making refuelling of satellites in space a reality. Projects I manage include RADICAL, working to refuel GEO and LEO telecoms satellties), and more...

Space skills
======

Since 2019, I have co-directed the [Space Skills Alliance](https://spaceskills.org/), a think-tank and consultancy addressing the UK's space skills shortage. We publish research, data, and expert analysis for the UK and Europe and generally try to make graphs that looks better than your average pie chart.  

Telecomms
======
From 2023 - 2025, I worked at [Goonhilly Earth Station](https://www.goonhilly.org/) on bid writing and training. 

Space curriculum development
======
From 2021 - 2023, I was a project manager at [Truro & Penwith College](https://www.truro-penwith.ac.uk/). I lead the development of the first Space Technologies HNC/HND and delivered the first space apprenticeship programme in Cornwall.

Astronomy research
======
From 2017 - 2021 I worked in astronomy research. My [PhD research](https://heidithiemann.github.io/research/) focused on a range of aspects of stellar variability (how stars change in brightness) in the SuperWASP all-sky survey. I worked on observing and modelling near-contact red giant binary stars, the _SuperWASP Variable Stars_ citizen science project, the rotation-activity relation, and the threat megaconstellations pose to ground-based astronomy.
